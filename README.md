Hi! This is a basic project that consists of a college feedback classifier, that works on data generated through an AI model (which you can see from the somewhat weird data).

The files in this repo are:

college_feedback_classifier.ipynb - Made in IBM watsonx, using jupyter notebook.
college_feedback_training.csv - Training data for the FLAN-T5 model used in this project.
college_feedback_test.csv - Test data for the model to classify feedback into the given departments.
